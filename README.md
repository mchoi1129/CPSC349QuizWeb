# CPSC349QuizWeb

Project 1
CPSC 349: Web Frontend Engineering (Spring 2024)
Due on 03/31 by 11:59 PM on Canvas

Project Topic: Quiz

Overview:
Build an interactive quiz web application using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. Do NOT
use React, as that will be your final project technology stack. The quiz web application must
have multiple-choice questions (minimum 10 questions). Give a catchy name to your quiz
web application.

A few ideas but not limited to:
● Multiple quizzes to choose from
● Login/Registration Page
● Score Tracker
● Partial point calculation
● Question bank with random questions popping up for different users
… and more

These are just a few ideas, but you can be as creative as possible. Take inspiration from
Kahoot or Canvas.

1. Project files (all the html, css, and js files).
2. Readme file on how to run the project.
3. Project report with a brief explanation of the project.
